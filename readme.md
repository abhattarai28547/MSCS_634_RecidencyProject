# Mobile Phone Data Science Project - Comprehensive Analysis

## Day 1 : Deliverable 1
## Dataset Summary and Key Insights

The dataset contains 1,019 mobile phones with 15 features including specifications, pricing, and ratings. After cleaning, 1,017 phones remained for analysis with key characteristics:
- **Price Range**: ₹99 to ₹489,990 (average: ₹35,007)
- **Rating Distribution**: 3.45 to 4.75 (average: 4.38/5)
- **Market Segments**: Budget (28%), Mid-range (36%), Premium (19%), Flagship (16%)

### Data Cleaning and Exploration Steps
1. **Missing Value Treatment**: Addressed missing data in processor (2.5%), storage (2%), and other fields
2. **Duplicate Removal**: Eliminated 2 duplicate entries based on phone names
3. **Feature Extraction**: Used regex to extract RAM, storage, battery capacity, and display size from text fields
4. **Outlier Detection**: Identified 87 price outliers using IQR method
5. **Feature Engineering**: Created derived features including price-per-GB ratios and performance scores

### Challenges and Solutions
- **Unstructured Data**: Text fields required regex-based extraction for meaningful features
- **High Missing Values**: FM radio (71%) and external memory (34%) data handled through appropriate imputation
- **Price Skewness**: Applied log transformation and outlier analysis for better modeling
